About this project

- Demonstrates how to use Grouped properties
- Consists of MessageAuthor and Message class
- Grouped property syntax can be used as follows:
    Message {
        author.name: "Alexandra"
        author.email: "alexandra@mail.com"
    }

As per Qt documentation,
A type that is exposed as a grouped property differs from an object-type property in that the grouped property is
read-only, and is initialized to a valid value by the parent object at construction. The grouped property's
sub-properties may be modified from QML but the grouped property object itself will never change, whereas an
object-type property may be assigned a new object value from QML at any time. Thus, the lifetime of a grouped property
object is controlled strictly by the C++ parent implementation, whereas an object-type property can be freely created and
destroyed through QML code.
