About this project

- Demonstrates how to expose the attributes of C++ types to QML
- Consists of Message and MessageBody class
- Message class exposes some of its members as PROPERTY so that it can be invoked from QML document
- Message class also holds MessageBody and exposes it as PROPERTY
- Before these classes can be used in QML, it must be properly set as context property which is done in main.cpp
