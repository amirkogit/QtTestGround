About this project

- Demonstrates how to expose properties with Object type
- Consists of Message and MessageBody class
- Message class exposes some of its members as PROPERTY so that it can be invoked from QML document
- Message class also holds MessageBody and exposes it as PROPERTY
- Message and MessageBody classes are same as in Take 1

- Before these classes can be used in QML, it must be properly set as context property which is done in main.cpp
    Here qmlRegisterType is used. Instead of instantiating object of Message class, whole Message is passed as an argument as follows:

    qmlRegisterType<Message>("org.qml_cpp_integration.example",1,0,"Message");
    qmlRegisterType<MessageBody>("org.qml_cpp_integration.example",1,0,"MessageBody");

    This will make it possible to write the following in QML document:

    Message {
        id: msg
        author: "New author name set." // invokes Message::setAuthor()
        body: MessageBody {
            description: "MessageBody description set" // invokes Message::setBody()
        }
    }
